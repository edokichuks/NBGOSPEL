Bro Chuks You fit not de happy with the files i upload sha..... No too vex abeg... 
there is one unable to load assets error i have been getting today i dont just know how to fix
that bug.
Its just so annoying i had to jst upload it that way

apart from that  its remaining the nav bar , to put the logo.... then the color i used the black and white , u said i should use a shade of black
i used black87 in some and normal black..please change it to ur suitable one,,... and ur homepage, instead of using list to write down the pastors different;y and the pictues
do u kmnow u can just make a widget where u can add the name,image ,even link,, that would be better...

like this

class Profile extends StatelessWidget{
final String name;
final String imageUrl;
final String url;
const Profile({key: key, required this.name, required this.imageUrl, required this.url});

@override
//then design the circular or square card u want for the home page... Bro this approach is better sha.
then make a model of the 3 
}
